# Sensor Tutorials with CircuitPython

This collection of tutorials covers using various sensors with CircuitPython and the Picopad board.

In the subfolders by sensor type you will find individual examples and further information.

You'll learn techniques for reading different sensor types, processing and visualizing sensor data, building reactive projects, and more.

Start with *intro* for basic concepts ðŸ˜‰

## What you'll learn

- Read digital, analog, I2C sensors
- Visualize measurements on the screen   
- Create games and instruments   
- Log data to cloud and SD card
- Manage concurrent tasks with asyncio

## Available Sensor Tutorials

### I2C Environmental Sensors

Use the SCD4x or BME280 for temperature, humidity, CO2 monitoring.

### DS18B20 Digital Temperature

Highly accurate 1-Wire digital temperature sensor provides reliable readings from -55Â°C to +125Â°C. It is available as official PicoPad module (https://pajenicko.cz/picopad-modul-s-digitalnim-cidlem-teploty-ds18b20) 

### HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance

Precise distance sensing from 2cm up to 4 meters for rangefinding. It is available as official PicoPad module (https://pajenicko.cz/picopad-modul-ultrazvukoveho-merice-vzdalenosti-hc-sr04)

### Photoresistor Light Sensor

Detect ambient light levels by reading an analog voltage. It is available as official PicoPad module (https://pajenicko.cz/picopad-modul-svetelneho-senzoru-gl5516)

### RP2040 Internal Temperature

Use the internal temperature sensor for basic temperature measurements. You can use this if you don't have any suitable external sensor module.

## Summary
The tutorials build from basic readings up to complete projects with visual output, data logging, and internet connectivity.

They cover core techniques like reading digital and analog data, display graphics, sprite animations, data storage, IoT, and async programming.
