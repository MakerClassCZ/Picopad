"""
In this simple example, you will learn how to interface with Picopad DS18B20 module.
It measures temperature and you can read the digital value via OneWire bus.

It requires the adafruit_onewire.bus and adafruit_ds18x20 libraries placed in /lib directory.
You can find the libraries in the CircuitPython library bundle (https://circuitpython.org/libraries).
